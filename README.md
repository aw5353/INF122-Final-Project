## Columns
Columns is a two-player tile-matching game where users take turns dropping gems onto the board to compete for the highest score. Player 1 can control their gem via the arrow keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí ‚Üê). Player 2 can control their gem via the WASD keys. The objective is to match at least 3 of the same colored gems together, which in turn causes them to disappear and add to the player's score. Gems spawn in vertical groups of three. Players can move the column of gems horizontally via ‚Üí ‚Üê or AD. Players can rotate the column of gems using W or ‚Üë, rotating the gems upwards. The players can also force-drop their column of gems using ‚Üì or S respectively to drop the column to the lowest available level. The game ends when it is unable to spawn anymore columns of gems into the board, at which point the game prompts the user with their statistics for that round, and a option as to whether or not they would like to play again.

## 2 * 2048
2 * 2048 is a twist on the hit tile-sliding game 2048, where 2 players play 2048 in a race to see who can reach the 2048 tile first. The unique twist is that both players' moves affect each other's boards - when one player makes a move, the same move is mirrored on their opponent's board. This creates an interesting strategic dynamic where players must consider not only their own optimal moves but also how those moves will impact their opponent's position.

### How to Play:
-Player 1 uses the Arrow Keys (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí)
-Player 2 uses WASD keys (W=up, S=down, A=left, D=right)
-When either player makes a move, both boards will shift in that direction
-The first player to create a 2048 tile wins!
-If a player runs out of valid moves, they lose

### Strategy:
The mirrored movement mechanic adds an extra layer of strategy, as players must:
-Plan their moves considering both their own board and their opponent's
-Sometimes sacrifice optimal personal moves to disrupt their opponent
-Race to build larger numbers while maintaining a playable board state
-The game ends when either a player reaches 2048 (victory) or can no longer make valid moves (defeat).
